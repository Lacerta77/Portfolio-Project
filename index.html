    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Kevin Hickman and I am an aspiring Software Developer. I was born</p>
    <p>and raised in North Eastern Ohio in the town of Newton Falls. I spent most of my</p>
    <p>life in the city of Hubbard, Ohio but I currently reside in Wentzville, Missouri.
    <p>I graduated from Hubbard High school in 2015 and have been working ever since.</p>
    <p>I've had a few odd jobs here and there and after my time with amazon it's time for a career.</p>

    <h2>Why Software Development?</h2>
    <p>Since the day I was born I've been around computers. My father was a software Developer</p>
    <p>with a degree in information technology. I always wanted to know as much about computers</p>
    <p>as he did. Being able to build programs from scratch was so facinating to me and after a few</p>
    <p>attempts at other fields, I have always come back to programming. I've never had the same interest
    <p>in any other field like I do with programming, and now with the oppurtunities I've been given </p>
    <p>it's time to pursue it.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Assuming this spot is blank, that is because this website is my first project! We are building</p>
    <p>our first website and I think mine turned out okay. I will eventually update it and have a nice</p>
    <p>layout for all my best projects but until then enjoy my first attempt at using javascript in HTML.</p>
